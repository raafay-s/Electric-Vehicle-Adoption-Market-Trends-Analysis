# Title
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the landscape of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption across the United States from 2018 to 2023. By leveraging data related to EV registrations, infrastructure availability, economic indicators, education levels, and political affiliation, I aimed to uncover meaningful insights about what drives EV growth and where the adoption gaps lie. I also analyzed how different socioeconomic and policy-based factors influence EV adoption and growth across states. The main objective was to conduct a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of the key enablers and obstacles in the EV transition using SQL and Power BI for analysis and visualization.

## Technologies and Libraries
* **Python (pandas)**: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and preparing the dataset for analysis
* **Oracle SQL**: Employed for querying, transforming, and organizing data into analytical views
* **Power BI for**: Utilized to build interactive dashboards and visualize key trends and insights

## Files Included
* **EV_Data.csv**: Raw dataset containing electric vehicle adoption and infrastructure data across U.S. states
* **EV_Data_Cleaned.csv**: Cleaned and preprocessed version of the raw EV dataset
* **ev_adoption_analysis_views.sql**: SQL script that creates analytical views for exploring EV trends and metrics
* **ev_adoption_schema_setup.sql**: SQL script to define and set up the database schema
* **ev_data_cleaning_script.py**: Python script used to clean, preprocess, and export the raw data

# Dataset Summary
I worked with a comprehensive dataset that compiled state-level EV adoption data from 2018 to 2023. The dataset contained economic indicators, environmental sentiment scores, charging infrastructure counts, and vehicle registration metrics across all 50 states
